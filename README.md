vpn-route
=========

Sometime you just need it. F*** GFW.

This script will help you to use local route when you connected to a VPN server. It works like adding an exception to your VPN routes.

local.txt is the net/mask db.

Usage
---
Change the `192.168.0.1` in the route.sh to your local router interface ip address, and execute:
`sudo ./route.sh`

if necessary, you may need to execute this command beforehand:
`chmod +x route.sh`
